# php-town-sorting

Let's assume a town has people with the highlighted ages, this PHP script sort them into two groups: children (under 18 years old) and adults (18 years old and above).

What i did is to first define the array of people with their ages. Then, I went ahead to define two empty arrays for children and adults. That way, the script can then loop through the people array and sorts each person into the appropriate array based on their age. 

In the end, the results are derived by iterating over each array and printing the names and ages of each person. You should try it out. You can even style it and build something more complex with it. 


I promised I would write basic scripts over the next 30 days with PHP already.
